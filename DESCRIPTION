Description: copernicus provides access to the COPERNICUS Global Land Service (http://land.copernicus.eu/global/).
    Currently, only Vegetation products are available : Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (V1: VGT instrument),
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (V2: PROBAV instrument), Leaf Area Index ,Fraction of Vegetation Green Cover,
    Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Vegetation Condition Index, Vegetation Productivity Index,
    Dry Matter Productivity, and Burnt Areas.
    The package provides functions to (i) download h5 files based on location (COPERNICUS tiling system),
    and (ii) convert (to tif), subset and project the downloaded files.
    The user should register on the data portal to access data.
    Pieces of code are taken/inspired from the MODIS package (v0.10-31): https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1252),
    Function arguments follow the same naming as in MODIS, as much as possible.
