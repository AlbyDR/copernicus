Title: Download and Extract COPERNICUS Global Land Vegetation Products
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Antoine Stevens
Maintainer: Antoine Stevens <antoinexstevens@gmail.com>
Description: Provides access to the COPERNICUS Global Land Service (http://
    land.copernicus.eu/global/). Currently, only Vegetation products are available :
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (V1: VGT instrument), Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (V2: PROBAV instrument), Leaf Area Index ,Fraction
    of Vegetation Green Cover, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active
    Radiation, Vegetation Condition Index, Vegetation Productivity Index, Dry
    Matter Productivity, and Burnt Areas. The package provides functions to (i)
    download h5 files based on location (COPERNICUS tiling system), (ii) convert
    (to tif), subset and project the downloaded files and (iii) compare the spatial
    and temporal agreement of two RasterBrick or RasterStack objects using the
    statistics described in Ji and Gallo (2006) Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote
    Sensing 72, 823-833 The user should register on the data portal to access data.
    Pieces of code are taken/inspired from the MODIS package (v0.10-31): https://r-
    forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1252), Function arguments follow the same naming
    as in MODIS, as much as possible.
